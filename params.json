{"name":"New York Taxi Analysis","tagline":"Ananlysis using Map-Reduce/HIVE on 2015 dataset provided by \"NYC taxi and limousine commission\"","body":"## Introduction \r\nBig Data involves large volume of data, which cannot be processed using traditional tools. These data sets are complex and evolves continuously in real time. The challenge is to analyze and extract useful knowledge from this volume of data. The paper focuses on analyzing New York City Taxi data (from Jan-2015 to Jun-2015). There are many areas which can increase an organization's profit by observing user patterns. Hence, we need some techniques in order to analyze the user behavior and accordingly generate some patterns. In this paper we will propose some general ideas by which we can gather user behavior and how that information can be used to generate further information specific to a user. We will use Hadoop echo system as our framework that will implement Map-Reduce to analyze these patterns in an acceptable time. Based on these patterns, we can suggest the user of the other related patterns.\r\n\r\n## DataSet  \r\n### 2015 Dataset\r\nNumber of Records: 77,080,575 Rows  \r\nSize of the file: 10.9 GB  \r\nLink: [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/view/ba8s-jw6u](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/view/ba8s-jw6u)  \r\n\r\n### Other Data Sets\r\n[2014 DataSset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/view/gn7m-em8n)  \r\n[2013 Trip Dataset](http://chriswhong.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nycTaxiTripData2013.torrent)  \r\n[2013 Fare Dataset](http://chriswhong.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nycTaxiFareData2013.torrent)  \r\n\r\n## Pre-Processing \r\nPre-processing has been performed using python script.

What about the precision of the location? What is the distance between the two rounded points? - answer of which, is not general for all the locations on the earth. General New York latitude and longitude is 40.XXXXX and -73.XXXXX/-74.XXXXX. Now as per the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees) distance between two decimal points, we round it based on 45N/S shown below. We have rounded latitude and longitude by three decimal points in pickup and drop-off locations, so the distance between the two points will be approximately 80 m.  \r\n\r\n[Top Pickup Location](www.googledrive.com/host/0B3OrYOq1dVQxcjJPOW1BWnFsYzQ/PickupLocation.html)  \r\n[Top Dropoff Location](www.googledrive.com/host/0B3OrYOq1dVQxcjJPOW1BWnFsYzQ/DropoffLocation.html)  \r\n\r\n![Top_Pickup_Dropoff_Location_Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parth8891/NYC_Taxi_Data_Analysis/master/Output/Images/Top_pickup_dropoff.png)\r\n\r\n### Traffic analysis by the taxi speed\r\nWe have used basic concept of physics speed = distance /time in this analysis and derived average speed, around a particular location. We have considered the drop-off location to compute speed. After specifying the drop-off location latitude and longitude, we get the average speed of the taxi around that location for every one hour. We have applied the logic- that if the average speed is high at a particular location, it implies that traffic is less in that area.   \r\n  \r\n![JFK_Speed_Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parth8891/NYC_Taxi_Data_Analysis/master/Output/Images/JFK_Speed_Analysis.png)\r\n\r\n### Most hectic hours of the day\r\nOne of the outputs we derived from this analysis was average number of pickups for a day in New York and for that we rounded the pickup time by an hour and counted the number of pickups for every hour and then we just divided the final count by 180 (because our data is from 01-Jan-2015 to 30-Jun-2015 which is 180 days). Using these outputs, taxi drivers can schedule their day and hence make maximum profit in a day.   \r\n  \r\n![Pickupcount_vs_hour](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parth8891/NYC_Taxi_Data_Analysis/master/Output/Images/Pickupcount_vs_hour.png)  \r\n\r\n### Most generous area of New York\r\nAs a final output, we calculated location wise, tip percentage. We counted the percentage tip given to the driver after rounding location by 3 decimal points and taking average of (tip_amount/total_amount)*100%.  \r\n  \r\n![Most_Generous_Area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parth8891/NYC_Taxi_Data_Analysis/master/Output/Images/Most_Generous_Area.png)\r\n\r\n## HIVE Queries\r\n[Source Code](https://github.com/parth8891/NYC_Taxi_Data_Analysis/blob/master/Hive-Queries/HIVE_Queries.sql)\r\n\r\n## Contact Me \r\n[Linked In] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/parthshah8891)  \r\n[Email](shahparth8891@gmail.com)  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
